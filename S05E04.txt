I'm going against the Randomizer. That's a very good attitude. That's a very good attitude. And Michael is just gonna happen to be here cooking next to me, right? -Good luck, Chef. -Thank you so much. -Good luck.

[Karen] On the Randomizer is tilapia, sweet potato, waffle iron, cheesy, and canned green beans. This might be my least favorite Randomizer I've ever gotten. Since I get the waffle iron, I'm immediately thinking of chicken and waffles. But fish and waffles. So this is where my mind is going.

Me too, Nancy, but that wasn't on my Randomizer. So I would say the green beans should be masked more. Marcus is still eating it. I love the flavor of this. But for me, that goat cheese kind of detracts from the flavor profiles here.

That Randomizer, I said this, man. You know, have a plan and then let the Randomizer laugh at you. Love the energy. Great job, chef.

I think I literally beat the Randomizer into submission, and it's a Randomizer game. So I'm hoping all that works out in my favor.
