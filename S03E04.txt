[Chris] Thirty minutes, it's just like restaurant service. The only difference is, is I got a picky diner called randomizer telling me what I can or cannot feed him for dinner. That's all the randomizer is. It's your worst guest.

Got to be honest, folks, I don't know, the randomizer has been too kind to these chefs, but they're making it work. Next up, Chef Chris Cosentino Chef Elizabeth Falkner will throw down in a battle for Bay Area bragging rights and in the main event, number one seed Chef Jet Tila will take on Chopped Next Generation winner Chef Carlos Anthony. Could we see a passing of the torch?

[Christian ] I left off the parsley, one of the randomizer ingredients, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. [Guy] Chef Tobias, Chef Christian, we'll see you in a bit. Thank you. [Christian] The parsley's a randomized ingredient and as upset as I am that the parsley does not make it onto the plate, I am still feeling confident I cooked a better steak than Tobias, so I still got a crack at this thing.
