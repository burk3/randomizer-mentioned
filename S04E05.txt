Humorous mentions of 'randomizer' found at:
====== 00:02:36 ======
...the Randomizer will be a little bit more challenging.
Oh, my goodness!
Not only will the Wild Card option
continue to get, um, wilder...
[exhales sharply]
[Guy] ...for the first time in TOC history,
you will be preparing a dish that has not just one...
...but two different proteins.
No!
Second round is called Surf and Turf Wars.

What a randomizer.
That is using a deli slicer too.
[Eric] Chef, you have, uh, that scotch bonnet?
[Jose] Yes, I do, actually.
-[Eric] Uh, can we share? -[Jose] Share? Yeah, sure.
For my Game Day Feast, I'm going global game day.
I'm thinking of the World Cup.
I'm thinking game day doesn't only exist here in the U.S.
So I needed to go outside the borders.

====== 00:36:42 ======
It was a really, really difficult randomizer.
I'm just glad that I got everything on the, uh, plate.
And I'm gonna leave it in the judges hands.
[crowd] 6, 5, 4...
[Guy] 3, 2, 1.
Chef's, that's it. Stop working!
[crowd cheering]
Oh, my god.
I've never been so stressed.
Thirty-five minutes went by like that.

====== 00:40:59 ======
That's not a randomizer.
But for a Game Day Feast,
I would've thought a little more oomph, or a little more heft here.
I shoulda did more.
Also, on the randomizer, the slicer was a big part of this.
I would slice the char and the lamb.
[imitates slicing sounds]
The lamb... I did get a lot of fat,
but presentation... I think this little cup is really nice.

====== 01:12:23 ======
I'm battling the randomizer.
The idea is that this poached egg
is gonna go on top of my fried veal cutlet
and then you know, you cut into it.
And even if it, like, happens to cook a little bit more,
I love hardboiled egg and mayonnaise sauce,
it's fine.
Pickling, good.
Ten minutes, ten minutes to be plated.
