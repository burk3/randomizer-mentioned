And then the Randomizer. [Brooke] This is really an arena for someone who needs to be able to think on their feet. Right. [Eric] So I have to make a dish with ground chicken cucumber, a meat mallet, that has to be seared, and we only have 25 minutes That's probably like the least forgiving thing on the entire Randomizer. By the time you actually start cooking, you're gonna have to take it off the stove like pretty soon. [laughs] What's your thoughts right from the beginning, Chef? Um, quick prayer. [crowd laughs]

My foundation is Indian food I think I am going to make a version of fish and chips with traditional Indian spices. The judges don't know who I am.

But the kielbasa, if it's gonna be like this, I needed it to be really browned, like fried, with, like, bread. I want brown toast! Yeah, I think we all want bread. Bread? [Alex] So, there was a Randomizer deficiency in terms of the toast note. I wanted maybe something a little bit more, balanced.
