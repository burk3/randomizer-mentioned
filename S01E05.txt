Let's go to the randomizer.
We've upped the difficulty on the randomizer.
It's now going a little unconventional.
You'll see items you definitely don't use every day.
How about a squab-jackfruit ice cream maker?
Alright! Let's get it going.
We're going to pick the protein, produce,
equipment, style, and time.
Antonia: I just don't want to use the ice cream maker.
Stop! You're going to make it happen!
Okay, sorry. This is the semi-finals.
One of these two going to the championship.

The randomizer you gave them whole duck, kohlrabi,
a turning slicer.
They had to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner
with both of those ingredients
and the use of the turning slicer,
and they had a whopping generous 60 minutes.
So, chef justin warner, to give us his final recap.
Judges, for breakfast, you have
a crème fraîche and chive omelet.
It is accompanied by malt vinegar duck cracklings.
The turning slicer was employed in the duck fat fried potato.
You have kohlrabi and its greens to accompany.
What do you think, judges?
First of all, this is like the olympics.
This is a big deal. And these chefs have really been
through the ringer and the randomizer.
I'm really impressed with the omelet.
