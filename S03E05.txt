I don't think the randomizer has ever been my friend. I have to make a soup and sandwich using oysters and parsnips. Oh, and also use a carbonator.

Chefs, let's take it to the randomizer. Right this way. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. -No. -[Amanda] Yes! Say yes to the randomizer. [Guy] Well, well, well, in the second round, the randomizer will determine the protein produce, piece of equipment and restaurant level style and cooking time. So, without further adieu, let's get after the protein. Woo! [audience cheering] I really feel like I'm gonna pass out. [Guy] Whole branzino. Okay, okay. [Guy] Pineapple.

A win is a win. The only thing I will say is it can't get much worse. The randomizer can't get much worse. I, I don't believe that. I don't believe that. Ladies and gentlemen, Chef Maneet Chauhan! [audience cheering] Chef, let's take a look at the bracket. Oh, my God! Tiffani Faison waiting for you. I'm afraid of her. I got all the faith in the world.

The big problem with this randomizer is pineapple. It has this enzyme in it called bromelain. Bromelain basically is like car battery acid. It basically dissolves everything. Horrible with a lot of things. So, they've got to be really careful to use that very judiciously. -You're just looking to bring some char out of that as well. -Yeah. Definitely.
