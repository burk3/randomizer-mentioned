[Guy] The only thing standingin your way, the Randomizer.
Right this way, chefs.
[cheers and applause]
[Britt] Let's do this.
[Guy] Okay. Any questions?
Oh, God. Fantastic.
Let's spin. Here we go.
Come on.
[cheers and applause]
[screams]
God.

Nancy Silverton called her first round dish
the best juice of the Randomizer
out of everything she has eaten so far.
As the TOC II champ,
she has won 14 battles
in this arena, more than any other chef
in TOC history.
Ladies and gentlemen, make noise
for the Dancing Spice Queen,
one and only, Chef Maneet Chauhan.
[cheers and applause]
[Guy] Now, that you're a TOC champ,
do you feel a little bit more free and easy?
I haven't slept all night. Okay.
And when I sleep, I get nightmares
of what Randa is going to give us.
I have seen snakes coming out of it.
Everything that I'm afraid of
in life comes out of that Randa.

It was a tough Randomizer.
I'm in the bad headspace of ten different dishes
bouncing around in my head.
Do I make a fried guinea hen,
a guinea hen spatchcock, a guinea hen under a brick?
I land on fried guinea hen,
which I think will work really well.
Because it is so dry, frying is the answer.
What are you gonna put into these aebleskiver?
[Amanda] Mac and cheese. [Simon] Ooh.

[Guy] The farther you go in the competition,
the harder the Randomizer becomes.
For the quarterfinals,
the Randomizer is going to go global
with international proteins, and produce,
and equipment.
You have 40 minutes to cook.
And remember, the chef with the highest scoring dish
at the end of this episode will get $5,000
donated to a restaurant of their choice
in their name,
thanks to our friends at State Farm.
Awesome. [Tobias] Yes.
And now the lineup for tonight.

====== 0:06:26 ======
Tonight, the Randomizer's got some goodies.
[Jet] Oh.
[Guy] We have four classic categories,
protein, produce, equipment, and style.
And this year includes one more fun,
little wacky nobody likes in area,
called the Wild Card.
I'm not mad at anything, so.
All right. Let's get after this.
Going for the protein.
[cheers and applause]
