Fantastic, chefs. To the Randomizer.
[audience cheering]
[Antonia] The Randomizer knows what it is that we're thinking.
It's gonna give me the things that I don't want.
- Are you seeing this? - Yeah.
[Guy] Randomizer is going to determine your protein, produce, equipment, style
- and time. Here we go! - [Antonia] Don't look at it.
[crowd cheering]
[Jet] I'm gonna look. I have to look.
- You didn't do time. - Time. Time. Time...
- Oh, I forgot the time. - That's not funny.
Oh!
- [Antonia] That's not funny. - Come on.
I feel like my heart rate is racing more.
[Guy] Oh, oh...
- [Antonia] Okay. That's nice. - [Guy] That's nice.

[Jet] Randomizer today is ever more evil.
But as soon as I see Hamachi collar, I'm ecstatic.
I know seafood.
I dropped outta high school to work on fishing boats.
And I spent my teen years on the ocean, working as a deck hand,
a boat cook, um, so I've been around fish and seafood
for over 30 years.
My inclination is use Hamachi collar in Japanese style.
Because that's where it came from and that's what it should be.
I'm going to do a salt grilled Hamachi collar.
And then I'm gonna marry it with a dish called Agedashi Tofu,

I have two things from my Randomizer inside of my ice cream.
My persimmons are in there and "frozen" is in there.
So I have to redo this before it costs me everything.
Luckily, the only good thing the Randomizer gave us was 50 minutes.
Adjusting ratios now, Chef?
Yes. And those anti-gridles are on?
The anti-gridle is essentially the opposite of a hot plate.
It's a cold plate.
And now we're gonna go down to the cold plate with the gelato mixture.
- [bell dings] - First time we've seen this used in a competition.
[Darnell] So I used the anti-gridle instead of the ice-cream maker this time,
because I can control this better myself.
[Justin] As you can see, Chef Darnell is folding this around the anti-gridle.
That's gonna give it a more ice-cream-like consistency

[Brooke] That Randomizer, each round,
gets exponentially more difficult.
I kind of just have to be prepared to let go
and accept it.
[Guy] Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[audience cheering]
Come on.
- [Brooke] Okay. - [Jet groaning]
- Really? Really? - [Jet] Oh, my God.
[Guy] Alligator, lion's mane, iSi, smoke, in 50 minutes.
Wow.

====== 1:01:07 ======
the Randomizer gets you.
This is the brilliance
and the meanness in this game, all in one.
[Guy] You have a bad habit
of crushing your friends' dreams.
It's not personal.
You are the best of the West!
[audience cheering]
For the second year in a row.
Woo!
[Guy] You have already given away $20,000,
