But I will tell you what, the Randomizer loves them. We got very lucky with the Randomizer. First, we had salmon. Then we had sweet onion. We had blender. Then we had charred. And then the habanero. I don't usually cook with habaneros and I know that Jose Garces is... That's in his wheelhouse, so I was a little bit worried.

Preparing for the Randomizer is futile. There is no preparation. But basil's great. It goes with everything. I love the combination of leeks and basil, so I think I'm gonna stuff some leeks with a little bit of beef sausage and make some basil sauces.

There's a lot of things to hit on the Randomizer, so... I just got outpointed. The first win at TOC for Marc Murphy. Third time's the charm.
