All right, chefs, over to the randomizer.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Some coffee.
GUY: The finer details of your dish
will be determined by the randomizer.
We are gonna pick the protein, produce,
equipment, style, and time. Ready to do this?
‐That's where we're here for. ‐So excited.
Oh, my God.

Looks like we have shrimp, carrots,
mandoline, stuffed,
and 35 minutes.
This sucks!

It's not just about talent, ladies and gentlemen.
It's about solving the culinary problem
that's thrown at you through the ridiculous randomizer.
So tonight's first battle is gonna be the seventh seed
from the East, Christian Petroni,
the number two seed in the East, Marc Murphy.
Gentlemen. Time to go to your green room.
Murph, you're that way, Christian, you're that way.
Chefs, stay close. You'll be battling next.
‐Yes. ‐All right.
Let's do it.

RICHARD: The Randomizer is the equalizer.
‐Here we go, guys. Let's go. ‐Ah.
♪
That's amazing.
Oh! All right, chefs.
Here's what you get to work with ground lamb, broccoli,
got to use the fryer equipment.
Grilled is the style,
and you've got 30 minutes to make it happen.
The 30 minutes,
obviously staring right in our face.
Yeah, you got to be aware of it
because the 30 minutes starts now.
To have a fryer and grilled, this is a tough one.

RICHARD: The randomizer set me up
with lamb, broccoli, fried, grill in 30 minutes.
Eh.
In my 25 years of being a chef,
I don't think I've ever seen a lamb and broccoli dish.
I don't know if I've ever had ground lamb
and broccoli on a menu anywhere.
Thank you, sir.
Chef, telling me what's going on, man.
I'm gonna do a little on Moroccan
style lamb fritter.

The chefs had to face the randomizer.
‐Oh, come on. ‐Oh, we knew it.
GUY: And all the dishes were judged completely blind.
Whoever made this clearly knows how to cook.
GUY: We saw one of the greatest upsets
in the history of cooking competitions
as number one seed in the West, Alex Guarnaschelli,
was toppled by up and coming, Darnell Ferguson.
ALL: Oh!
This is super embarrassing for me.
GUY: And the upsets continue.
