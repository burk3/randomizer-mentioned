I already don't love this.
The randomizer will determine the various components of your dish.
Now, we have the proteins,
produce, equipment, and style.
There's a dark one.
I know.
Do you see this dark, blackout one?
Oh, wow.
Right.
Oh, okay.
Uh, normally that's time.

What do we got here?
[Guy] That is called Wild Card.
What is this?
[Guy] 30 minutes to cook.
Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen
the randomizer for the final round tonight.
Come on, baby.
[Guy] Number one versus number eight.
Come on, baby.
[Guy] Number one versus number eight.
Here we go! Protein!
